## Templates
A template file is a FHIR event message bundle, in XML or JSON format, that has elements marked up that will be replaced by data values. The [Handlebars templating language](http://handlebarsjs.com/), which is an extension to the well known Mustache templating language, is used to mark up elements.

Template files live in the directory `/templates`.

Template files use the following naming convention: `<event name and version if required>.template.<json | xml>`

Examples: `physicalExamination.template.json   physicalExamination.template.xml`
