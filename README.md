## Templates
Template files live in the directory `/templates`. A template file is a complete FHIR event message bundle in XML or JSON format. Within a file elements that will be replaced by data values
are marked up using the [Handlebars templating language](http://handlebarsjs.com/), which is an extension to the well known Mustache templating language.

Template files use the following naming convention: `<event name and version if required>.template.<json | xml>`
Examples: `physicalExamination.template.json   physicalExamination.template.xml`
